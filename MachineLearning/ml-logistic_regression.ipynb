      "Review: by now you ve probably heard bit about new disney dub of miyazaki s classic film laputa castle in the sky during late summer of 1998 disney released kiki s delivery service video which included preview of laputa dub saying was due out 1999 it s obviously way past that year now but dub has been finally completed and s not laputa castle in the sky just castle in the sky for dub since laputa not such nice word spanish even though they use word laputa many times throughout dub you ve also probably heard that world renowned composer joe hisaishi who scored movie originally went back rescore excellent music with new arrangements laputa came out before my neighbor totoro after nausicaa of valley of wind which began studio ghibli s long string of hits and my opinion i think s one of miyazaki s best films with powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour four minute gem laputa castle sky film for all ages i urge everyone see for those unfamiliar with castle sky s story begins right at start doesn t stop for next two hours the storytelling so flawless masterfully crafted you see miyazaki s true vision and believe me s one fantastic one the film begins with sheeta girl with one helluva past she being held captive by government airship sheeta holds key laputa castle sky long lost civilization the key laputa sacred pendant she has which sought by many namely government military air pirate group dola gang who sheeta pazu later befriend soon pirates attack ship she escapes during raid she falls few thousand feet but fall soft thanks her pendant as she floats down from sky pazu orphan boy who survives by working mines sees sheeta catches her the two become fast friends but thanks her pendant two get caught up one huge thrill ride dola gang government try capture sheeta one action sequence after another we learn all of character s motives identities we build emotional action packed climax which will surely please all with s fantastic animation wonderful dialogue plus somewhat twisty surprise i think this film simply remarkable does hold for two hour four minute run time the story wonderful we peak into hayao miyazaki s animation which has no limits the setting of film combo of many time periods it does seem take place at end of 1800s but some alternante universe which has advanced technology weapons laputa also surprisingly funny film the film has tons of hilarious moments almost equal drama action film holds i think funniest part fight scene where pazu s boss faces off against pirate soon after riot breaks out it s funny we see men compare their strength music fits right with perfectly now let s talk about how dub rates excellent cast give some great performances bring these characters life teen heartthrob james van der beek plays hero pazu who has much more mature voice then japanese version where original he sounded more childlike either way i think his voice nice fit with pazu anna paquin young oscar winner from the piano plays sheeta this also nice performance but voice bit uneven she doesn t stay true one accent at times she sounds american apple pie but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman who played mama dola not only this excellent performance but voice emotion she gives character really brings life if there was ever live action laputa movie g d forbid she would be one play her you can just imagine her role well somewhat luke skywalker himself mark hamill muska this another top rate hamill performance you may be familiar with hamill from long line of voice work after he did original star wars movies but he renders muska full evil his voice sounds like his regular voice mix of joker who he played for many episodes animated batman series rounding out cast voice character actor jim cummings who does great gruff job general andy dick mandy patakin members of dola gang now let me talk about what really makes this dub special joe hisaishi s newly arranged music for those who have never heard of him mr hisaishi does music like all of miyazaki s films music very memorable each of his scores has s own personas which fits particular film perfectly now these new arrangements he has done are more american like which i think was goal of new recordings don t worry classic tunes of japanese version are still here great form the score me sounds be arranged like this hollywood blockbuster it has more power has more emphasis s clearer deeper the film s prologue first seconds where we are introduced airships has some new music i am not sure but i believe when we first saw ships there was no music at all but majority of music has new backdrops more background music enjoy things seem very enhanced in powerful scene music more stronger then original versions in calm scene s more calmer overall i think many of you will be pleased with new arrangements mixes i highly did myself personally think helps improve film i prefer new score over old one i hope disney will release license music rights full blown soundtrack another plus side dub that story remains faithful much of original japanese lines are intact in kiki i m sure few lines where changed this same way lines have been changed but majority are close exactly original lines dialogue miyazaki has written i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered but they were there intact some new lines have been added well which help out but i am not sure whether consider this good thing bad thing disney did not translate ending song was japanese i was mortified when they did completely new songs for kiki dub but with this version s original song  japanese so i guess s good s still original but bad since majority of people seeing this dub speak english there big down side this dub deals with how voices match character s lips of course any dub won t be perfect but i think kiki mononoke dubbing of lines match were much better executed disney had little bit more time with this one  some of time everything matches perfect some of time doesn t completley match  rare case someone says something lips don t move at all there s scene where sheeta chuckles her mouth doesn t move one bit as far things about film itself these are my thoughts i thought most amazing part of laputa was animation from opening sequence ending animation so lush detailed you just have watch awe you see true nature of each character true detail their face with extreme close ups action you have give ton of credit for effort that these animators put into this film everything so well done beautifully hand drawn s like moving piece of art and think this was done mid 1980 s the animation quite different from disney ghibli has s own distinctive flare which very different but very good and after all these years colors look vibrant ever laputa also has tons of action sequences lots of plane dogfights plus few ground these sequences are so well done so intriguing s scary that they are comparable big budget action film and finale just something you must see the sound effects are pure classic fit explosions guns firing everything else well and like all miyazaki films each one focuses different theme i g kiki confidence this one has great lesson greed power people don t realize how greed can take over you how having too much power isn t good people are obsessed with power are greedy main villian muska greatly shows this all all laputa castle in the sky was great film begin with now improved for most part i am glad more mainstream audience now have chance see this classic animated film all s glory with great voice cast who put lot into film with excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi disney has done nice job this dub quite worthy though i think voices matched mouths better kiki princess mononoke disney dubs castle in the sky still great dub worth long delays because now more can expierence fantastic film \n",

      "Review: i m going write about this movie about irreversible  famous scene  so you are warned if you haven t seen movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think movie fails end pun intended acting wise rosario dawson really good almost conveys portraying someone almost decade younger teenager other words the villain guy good but loses his evil touch right before end if he really never changes then why would he let woman tie him up he wouldn t period then we also have bartender 2nd rape dude actually i don t think you would need him at least not for 2nd rape but more about that later let s reprise story rosarios character sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with female friend this wasn t intentional rosario states herself but there sexual tension between them rosario s character meets guy who sexual predator all bad senses but he makes impression her rosario commented that her character had boyfriend before i beg differ because she acts if her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here s another problem after first rape takes place rosarios character doesn t tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldn t call her mother anymore would behave strangely mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at party s obvious there something going boom she gone the first rape almost unbearable watch but feels like pinch when you compare ending rape which feels like you re getting hit with sledge hammer after rape no 1 we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such her construction work indication that she might be lesbian one guy states who tried hit her  but left open no real social contact established if you leave bartender guy out who involved 2nd last rape scene it s apparent that he isn t nice guy his character get s fleshed out bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist class again his being movie seems pointless we get point that rosarios character isn t same anymore that she went bad able hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs other stuff back rapist 1 who cheats test gets caught by rosarios character they decide hang out together again really as absurd that sounds guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately his football career well career stretch he bullied this attempt give his character some depth almost works but then again too cliché stay with you so rapist 1 submits rosarios character  why exactly because he promised her was her day again really guy like that never loses control especially with woman he raped before  i guess this supposed show us how stupid he the bartender guy would have worked someone who could have hit him over head something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have drug his drink so rapist 1 undresses get s blindfolded let s rosarios character tie him bed  seriously that s just crazy but what comes next even crazier first she talks him then she shuts him up forces object into him this difficult watch rape scene number one this isn t about what this guy deserves not s just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she done bartender guy comes rapes  rapist 1 if this really should work revenge movie would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all revenge having henchman doing job takes away everything that was built up this isn t supposed be entertaining enjoyable s hard watch  art house but 10 minute i didn t count rape scene at end just smashes everything rosarios character more less only watching what happens which brings me biggest disappointment irreversible comparison irreversible had rape scene but movie went even if was back into time rosario looking into camera end says something about having get over this first that comes bit too late that should see her say that after initial rape and secondly most importantly this where art house movie should ve come it more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after second rape scene how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn t actually physically do that much see above  broken character that movie cuts off good intentions talia rosario had worked before but failing convey most of things they set out do even if you can see what they meant has be convincing otherwise doesn t work  not mention overlong rape scenes they are \n",
